            <br>
            <div>Boostr connects highschool STEM teams with potential sponsors.
                It's a way for engineering and science people to easily fundraise, and tell their stories.
                <br><br>
                Everyone here at Boostr is on either our school's robotics team, science olympiad team, a VEX team, or science club. We're passionate about building robots, competing, and doing science, and fundraising is an integral part of making that feasible. By using Boostr, teams have raised <span class="raised">$<span class="counter">200</span></span>M in support. We'll connect you with your community, so that you can do what you love, instead of fumbling for funding.
